# Create ECF File

When compiling a simple Eiffel system like a *Hello World* program, there
is no real need for an ECF file. But when the Eiffel system becomes more
complex, an ECF file is necessary to describe it. Use the command *Create
ECF File* to **generate your first ECF file**.

You can then edit this ECF file and customize it. Learn more about ECF files
in the [Gobo Eiffel documentation](https://www.gobosoft.com/eiffel/gobo/library/tools/doc/ecf.html).

This command is available in the *Command Palette*. Open the *Command Palette*
with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on MacOS) and type `Gobo Eiffel` to see
available commands for this extension.
  
The same command is also available from the right-click contextual menus for
Eiffel files (`.e`) in both the *Editor* and *Explorer* panels.
